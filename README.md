# Fursuit Detector

Detects fursuits and stuff, I guess

Created using Next.js with TypeScript, Flask, and PyTorch for the AI stuff.

## Project structure

- `client` - Next.js app
- `tool` - AI stuff required to detect pictures

Some of the AI stuff doesn't like it when it's placed on it's
own folder - and most of the back-end is on the root directory.

## Get it up and running locally

Clone this repo, cd into the `client` folder and install it:

```sh
# cd from client
cd client

# Install that baby
npm i

# or install via yarn
yarn install
```

Then, start a local dev server by running:

```sh
npm run dev

# or install via yarn
yarn dev
```
